                <h2> Law G. Backstory</h2>
                <p>This page is strictlyy about my Backstoryand why I wanted to be in this crazy world of information Technology as a whole. I will give a brief summary as to why I chosee this profession.<br> 
                The box below is my persoanl backstory as to how I got here and where I came from as a person. Enjoy!</p>
                
                <div><img src= " images/babyAhhlaw.jpeg"width=150 height=150 > Starting off, I was born and halfway raised in Atlanta,GA.<br> I was raised in a two parent household that with an older sister<br>
                that was very hard on me. <br> My father was very tech savvy guy and he instilled the skills in me early.<br> He introduced me to Python and C# when I was about 13.<br>From that point on I knew that tech was my calling.<br>
                In highschool I would recode minecraft and other cool online games to my liking<br>and that is what helped me advance my skillset coming into college.<br>
                
                <p>Relating back to highschool, I graduated with a 2.6 GPA.<br>and compared to my peers that was very low considering my goals. <br> I came into college with a fresh and open mind<br>
                    that was extremely important as I knew I had to make a way.</p>
                
                <p>I came into college and my first semester I got a 3.9 GPA.<br> My energy was unmatched from there on out as I made th deans list five times since then.<br> 
                I became very interested in every aspect of IT and I mastered all of my classes.<br> I promsied myself I will be great and so far I have been and that is my story.</p>
