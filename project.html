            <h1>Previous IT Projects</h1>
            <p> 1. CREDIT CARD FRAUD: The credit card fraud detection features uses<br> user behavior and location scanning to check<br> for unusual patterns. These patterns include<br> user characteristics such as user spending<br> 
                patterns as well as usual user geographic<br> locations to verify his identity. If any unusual<br> pattern is detected, the system requires<br> revivification.(2020)<br></p>
            <p> 2. COLLECTIVE FACE DETECTION: This collective face detection project is capable of<br> detecting faces by their names and identifying multiple<br> faces in real time. The software system uses<br> 
                face detection algorithms to accurately identify and<br> recognize a faces in real time. We use a pc webcam<br> to record real time video data and the system <br>automatically detects and identifies faces in real<br> time application. The collective face detection 
                application<br> is designed using Java.(2020)</p>
            <p> 3. ANTI-VVIRUS APP: This project uses the combined concept of signature<br> byte code detection and pattern matching to detect<br> the presence of any malware in the android device<br> and helps getting rid of it so that the user<br> can make the optimum use of the device. It scans<br> 
                various files and checks them against a viral code<br> to detect any signs of a virus or malware. If a<br> virus is found the software app performs one of the two<br> actions which are: Quarantining- Separating the affected<br> files into a separate quarantine zone.
                and <br>Deleting- Simply deleting the affected files.(2020)</p>
            <p> 4. VIDEO SURVALLAINCE: This is an very innovative approach to video surveillance software<br> project. We normally find video camera’s in banks<br> and other organization that continuously record<br> and save the recorded video footage for days or months.(2021) </p>
