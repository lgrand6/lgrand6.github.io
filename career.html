            I am currently searching for jobs everyday even though I have<br> over three offers. I want the most offers I can possibly<br> receive because
            I want to weigh my options to make sure<br> I am making the decision that is best for me. I take things such as<br>location into account when I
            make my chcoices on where to<br> apply as well as where I want to reside in the coming years.<br> I want to not only elevate myself but I want to be able to
            be the one that makes <br> a change in my community. I want to be that force for the youth.<br> I am currently looing for jobs in the western part of the U.S.<br>
